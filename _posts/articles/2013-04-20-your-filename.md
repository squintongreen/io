# Test Post

This is a new post.

>There’s always time to take time. A moment to breathe. A pause; a rest – they’re always there. Stop. Look. Listen. Close your eyes and feel the air entering your lungs and filling your body. Feel everything leaving your body as you exhale. Slowly. Yes, nice and easy. Let it fall from you, don’t force it.
